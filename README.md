RippleApp
=========
I decided to make an application that a user can directly into an API call into and can get a response back from the Ripple Network. This can be useful for users to get any information they need from the network. 

My app works spefically well if a user wants to get the dates of the most recent transactions or the ledger hash. I thought it would be interesting information to be able to tell how many transactions have been completed since a user logs into the network so this count is displayed as well. 

My initial idea was to take the information as to how many transactions were completed within a certain date and use that information to add it into a calendar user interface to be able to show the number of transactions that took place everyday.
